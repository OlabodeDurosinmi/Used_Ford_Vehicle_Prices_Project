# Price Prediction for Used Ford Vehicles

# Comprehensive Objective:

The objective of this project is to conduct an in-depth analysis of Ford car listings to uncover key insights related to pricing, performance, and vehicle characteristics. Specifically, the analysis aims to evaluate average car prices by model and year, understand the impact of transmission type and fuel type on price and fuel efficiency, and explore correlations between engine size, mileage, and cost. Additionally, the project seeks to assess tax variations across fuel types and models. Through the use of pivot tables, the project will identify the highest-mileage models, dominant transmission types per model, fuel types with the greatest accumulated mileage, and models contributing most significantly to total engine size and pricing. This comprehensive analysis will support data-driven decision-making for stakeholders in the automotive market.
